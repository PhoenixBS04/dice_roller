One day our team decided to play a game of D&D, but unfortunately our game master forgot to bring dice, and it seemed that the game would end before it had even started. However, we managed to come up with a creative solution: we created a telegram bot with the help of python to let the game master continue the game using digital dice instead of real ones.  Moreover the dice themselves can be different, for example in our bot there are 4 types of dice in size that is 4 6 12 20. Our bot is deployed at "@hse_dice_roller_bot" and is currently active. Anyone can go to that address and try it out. The functionality is quite intuitive, once you click "start" the bot welcomes you and offers to get you started. After clicking "lets begin" a menu appears with a selection of the number of dice edges to choose from, just as we said before. Choose any dice you like and the result will be shown. Then you can reset the dice or choose another one if you want to change to.
